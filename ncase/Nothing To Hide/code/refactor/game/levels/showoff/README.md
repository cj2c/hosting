HOW TO CREATE A CUSTOM LEVEL

Copy this folder and rename it

To test this level, go to `index.html?level=<YOUR LEVEL NAME>`

To test multiple levels in sequence, go to `index.html?level=[<LEVEL_1>,<LEVEL_2>,<LEVEL_3>]`

**Basic**

Just edit level.json & map.txt

**Adding Art**

Add to the assets folder, and link to them in assets.json

**Custom Logic**

Edit custom.js


HOW A LEVEL FOLDER SHOULD BE STRUCTURED
===

/assets 	: all misc images/sounds/scripts can go here

assets.json : tells game engine what assets to preload
custom.js 	: custom level scripting that runs when this level starts
level.json  : data on this level's gameonbjects / gamelogic / wallobjects
map.txt 	: a level map in ASCII form

Created the Apollo 16 Far Ultraviolet Camera/Spectrograph
Three years earlier received patent for a Far Ultraviolet Electrographic Camera that received images in electromagnetic radiation in short wavelengths
Picture of Earth from a distance in ultraviolet light to show the hydrogen atmosphere, the polar auroris, and the tropical air glow belt
Dr. Carruthers quoted to Apollo 16 astronauts about the Far Ultraviolet Camera: "the most immediately obvious and spectacular results were really for the Earth observations, because this was the first time that the Earth had been photographed from a distance in ultraviolet light, so that you could see the full extent of the hydrogen atmosphere, the polar auroras and what we call the tropical airglow belt.". .
Using a sounding rocket he was the first to detect molecular hydrogen in space in 1970
Developed a rocket instrument that captured images in ultraviolet of Comet Halley.
On the STS-39 space shuttle in 1991, a two camera, with different far-UV wavelength sensitivities
Worked on the UV imaging of Earth’s polar auroras and the faint photochemical luminescence that’s found in the upper atmosphere using an instrument called GIMI; acronym for Global Imaging Monitor of the Ionosphere. This instrument was on a Department of Defense satellite, ARGOS (Advanced Research and Global Observation Satellite), which was launched in 1999.
Awarded the National Medal of Technology and Innovation in 2012. This award was considered the nation’s highest honor for technological achievement.

NRL (Naval Research Laboratory), and SSD (Space Science Division) Dr. George Carruthers
National Medal of Technology and Innovation awarded on 2012, given to George Carruthers in February 1, 2013.
Grew up during the space race and was interested in space science during his youth.
While he was a young boy, he built telescopes and model rockets; he was also known as an enthusiastic reader to his local libraries.
In his young adulthood, his childhood interests led him to pursue degrees in Aeronautical, Nuclear, and Astronautical Engineering at the University of Illinois.
After receiving a fellowship in Rocket Astronomy from the National Science Foundation, George Carruthers accepted a position at NRL in 1964.
Throughout working with NRL SSD, Carruthers forused his attention on the ultraviolet captures or observations of the Earth’s atmosphere in the ionosphere, and of astronomical phenomena; otherwise known as a comet.
He received a patent for his inventions and innovations instrumentation in 1969; “Image Converter for Detecting Electromagnetic Radiation Especially in Short Wave Lengths” (nrl.navy.mil) -- This detected electromagnetic radiation in short wave lengths.
Carruthers’ Far Ultraviolet Camera Spectrograph was sent to the moon on the Apollo 16 mission in 1972. This was the first moon-based space observatory.
The 50lbs. Gold-plated camera system:
Allowed researchers to get an ultraviolet observation of Earth and space
Allowed researchers to take readings of as well as get an understanding of objects and elements in space that’re too small for the naked eye to see.
Could capture stars and the solar systems thousands of miles away.
NRL camera still on the moon today.
A second version of the NRL camera was sent to the moon in 1974 called Skylab. This was used to study comets, especially the observation of Halley’s Comet.
George Carruther was known to be principal or lead investigator for multiple NASA and DoD sponsored space projects and instruments. This included a 1986 rocket instrument that captured ultraviolet images of Halley’s Comet.
He captured an image of a Leonid meteor shower entering the Earth’s atmosphere during an experiment on DoD Space Test Program Advanced Research and Global Observation Satellite (ARGOS)
Was one to receive a National Medal and was in recognition by President Barack Obama who said, “I am Proud to honor these inspiring American innovators. They represent the ingenuity and imagination that has long made this Nation great--and they remind us of the enormous impact a few good ideas can have when these creative qualities are unleashed in an entrepreneurial environment.”
The National Medal of Science was created by law in 1959, this administered for the White House by the National Science Foundation.
This award is given annually
Recognizes individuals who’ve made excellent contributions to science and engineering.
Chosen by a committee of Presidential appointees which nominises on the basis of extraordinary knowledge in as well as contributions to chemistry, engineering, computing, mathematics, or biological, behavioral/social, and physical sciences.
National Medal of Technology and Innovation was created by law in 1980, this is administered for the White House by the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Patent and Trademark Office.
